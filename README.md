What is version control ?
Version control is the process of managing changes to software code or other types of documents over time. It allows multiple people to work on the same files simultaneously, while keeping track of all changes made and providing a way to revert to previous versions if necessary.
Version control systems keep a complete history of every change made to a file, including who made the change, when the change was made, and what the change was. This makes it easy to see how a project has evolved over time, and to identify when and where bugs were introduced.

Version control is essential for collaboration among software developers, as it allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase without overwriting each other's changes. It also provides a way to review changes made by others before incorporating them into the project.

There are many version control systems available, with Git being one of the most popular. Other notable version control systems include Subversion (SVN), Mercurial, and Perforce.
