Ques:-1 what is Git?
Ans:- Git is a version control system that helps you keep track of changes made to your code over 
time.
It allows you to collaborate with others on a project, keep track of different
versions of your code, and easily revert to previous versions if needed.

Ques:-2 what is GitHub?
Ans:- GitHub is a website that allows you to store your code online and collaborate with others. 
It uses Git as its version control system, so you can keep track of changes made to your 
code over time, work with others on the same codebase, and easily share your code with the world.

Ques:-3 Why it is important?
Ans:- Tracking the changes and updates. We can see who made which changes. Git also provides 
when and why a change was made.
Allowing them to work collaboratively. Software development projects usually require many people
to work together.
Git provides developers with a systematic way of doing that. Thus, the developers focus on the 
project instead of extensive communication sessions between the other developers.

Ques:-4 what is Version Control ?
Ans:-Version control is the process of managing changes to software code or other types of 
documents over time.
It allows multiple people to work on the same files simultaneously, while keeping track of all 
changes made and providing a way to revert to previous versions if necessary.
-------->> two types of version control system <<<-------------------
1. Distributed version control system(DVCS):-
Git is a Distributed Version Control System.
In DVCS every contributor has a local copy or clone of the main repository i.e everyone maintenancea local repo of their own which containers all the files & metadata present in the main repository.
2. Centralized version control system(CVCS):- 
GitHub is a Centralized Version Control System
suppose you have a repository and everybody came and distribute the code and suddenly 
the server is crash, in that case, everything in your code is gone.
